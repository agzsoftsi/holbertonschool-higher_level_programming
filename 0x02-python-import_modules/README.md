# 0x02. Python - import & modules
## General
Why Python programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in function dir()
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.4)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks
0 -0-add.py - Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

- You have to use print function with string format to display integers
- You have to assign:
- the value 1 to a variable called a
- the value 2 to a variable called b
- and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
- a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
- Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line
- You can only use the word add_0 once in your code
- You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
- Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__, like the example below


1 -1-calculation.py - Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.

- Do not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
- You have to define:
- the value 10 to a variable a
- the value 5 to a variable b
- and use those two variables only, as arguments when calling functions (including print)
- and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 10 and another b = 5
- Your program should call each of the imported functions. See example below for format
- the word calculator_1 should be used only once in your file
- You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
- Your code should not be executed when imported

2 -2-args.py - Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

- The output should be:
- Number of argument(s) followed by argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by
: (or . if no arguments were passed) followed by
- a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),
- one line per argument:
- the position of the argument (starting at 1) followed by :, followed by the argument value and a new line
- Your code should not be executed when imported
- The number of elements of argv can be retrieved by using: len(argv)
- You do not have to fully understand lists yet, but imagine that argv can be used just like a C array: you can use an index to walk through it. There are other ways (which will be preferred for future project tasks), if you know them you can use them.

3 - 3-infinite_add.py - Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments

The output should be the result of the addition of all arguments, followed by a new line
You can cast arguments into integers by using int() (you can assume that all arguments can be casted into integers)
Your code should not be executed when imported

4 -4-hidden_discovery.py - Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally).

- You should print one name per line, in alpha order
- You should print only names that do not start with __
- Your code should not be executed when imported
- Make sure you are running your code in Python3.4.x (hidden_4.pyc has been compiled with this version)

5 -5-variable_load.py - Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.

- You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
- Your code should not be executed when imported

6 -100-my_calculator.py -Write a program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basics operations.

Usage: ./100-my_calculator.py a operator b
- If the number of arguments is not 3, your program has to:
print Usage: ./100-my_calculator.py <a> <operator> <b> followed with a new line
exit with the value 1
operator can be:
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
- If the operator is not one of the above:
print Unknown operator. Available operators: +, -, * and / followed with a new line
exit with the value 1
- You can cast a and b into integers by using int() (you can assume that all arguments will be castable into integers)
- The result should be printed like this: <a> <operator> <b> = <result>, followed by a new line
- You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
- Your code should not be executed when imported

7 - 101-easy_print.py - Write a program that prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output.

- Your program should be maximum 2 lines long
- You are not allowed to use print or eval or open or import sys in your file 101-easy_print.py

8 - 102-magic_calculation.py - Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b):

9 - 103-fast_alphabet.py - Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line.

- Your program should be maximum 3 lines long
- You are not allowed to use:
- any loops
- any conditional statements
- str.join()
- any string literal
- any system calls
