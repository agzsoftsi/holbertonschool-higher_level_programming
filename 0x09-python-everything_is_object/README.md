29. Python3: Mutable, Immutable... everything is object!
Write a blog post about everything you just learned / this project is covering. Your blog post should be articulated this way (one paragraph per item):

- introduction
- id and type
- mutable objects
- immutable objects
- why does it matter and how differently does Python treat mutable and immutable objects
how arguments are passed to functions and what does that imply for mutable and immutable objects

- If you worked on advanced tasks, please also include what you did learn in those tasks in the blog post.

30. #pythonic #advanced
Write a function magic_string() that returns a string "Holberton" n times the number of the iteration (see code):
